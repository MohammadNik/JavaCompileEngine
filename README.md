# JavaCompileEngine
JavaCompileEngine is a efficient open source Compiling Library, useable in Java frameworks for compiling programming languages files and Processing Commands with realtime feedback.
  
## Why Is This Project Useful?
I wrote this project out of curiousity but it's useful it many situations. I list some of them below.
  - Programming Contests
  - Online Compilers
  - Online Code Practice with Purpose of Learning
