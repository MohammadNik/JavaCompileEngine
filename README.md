# JavaCompileEngine
JavaCompileEngine is a efficient open source Compiling Library, usable in Java frameworks for compiling programming languages files and Processing Commands with realtime feedback. I wrote this project out of curiosity but it's useful in many situations e.g. Programming Contests Sites, Online Compilers, Online Code Learning and etc.
